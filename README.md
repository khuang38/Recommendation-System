# Java Web Service Development â€“ Personalized Recommendation Engine for Events
PROJECT DEMO [DEMO](http://18.221.144.80/Jupiter/).

## Project Abstract
This project aims to build an personalized recommendation system for users to find various events nearby. Users can buy the tickets by clicking the results they are interested in provided by the system. Users can add some events they like to "My Favorites" so that the liked events will be stored in our database. Also, after a user put an event into "My Favorites", the recommendation system will use an algorithm to find some similar events and provide them to user in "Recommendation".
